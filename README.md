### Frontend Setup

I created a new repo on my github.
Inside the new repo I created a **frontend** folder. For now that will suffice, I might add a backend folder later, depending on the need for the project.

Before we begin we need to check if we have Node.js installed.

**What is Node.js?**

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server-side. Unlike JavaScript running in the browser, Node.js provides a way to build scalable network applications using the same language you use for frontend development. It’s important to note that Node.js isn’t part of JavaScript—it’s a separate installation that brings server capabilities to JavaScript. You can download it from the official Node.js website.

Verify the installation with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Create the Vite React Project

To create a React project with Vite (https://vite.dev/guide/).

Cd into the frontend folder, open a terminal and type:

```bash
npm create vite@latest .
```

Options that I chose: **JavaScript** and **React**.

#### Installing Dependencies

Let us now take a look at all the dependencies we will need for the project.

We will use:

```
Express
TailwindCSS
```
