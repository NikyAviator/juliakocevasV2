### Frontend Setup

I created a new repo on my github.
Inside the new repo I created a **frontend** folder. For now that will suffice, I might add a backend folder later, depending on the need for the project.

#### Create the Vite React Project

To create a React project with Vite (https://vite.dev/guide/).

Cd into the frontend folder, open a terminal and type:

```bash
npm create vite@latest .
```

Options that I chose: **JavaScript** and **React**.

#### Installing Dependencies

Let us now take a look at all the dependencies we will need for the project.

We will use:

```
Express, NodeJS, TailwindCSS
```
